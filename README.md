# UPassport: A Decentralized Identity and Multimedia Terminal for the ƒû1 Ecosystem

## üåü Overview

UPassport is a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) web application designed as a versatile terminal for interacting with the ƒû1 (Duniter) cryptocurrency and the decentralized web. It acts as a bridge between user interactions, multimedia handling, and secure identity management within the ƒû1 ecosystem, leveraging the `Astroport.ONE` infrastructure.

UPassport aims to solve the Human/Machine Trust dilemma by providing a FOSS solution for establishing a fully trusted decentralized information system based on NOSTR and IPFS. This system is built to respect space-time equivalent distance for everyone on the internet.
